# pairstair Homebrew Formula

## Homebrew Formula Architecture Support

The Homebrew formula for `pairstair` now supports multiple platforms and CPU architectures:

- macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- Linux (Intel and ARM64)

During installation, the formula automatically downloads the correct binary for your platform and architecture, renames it to `pairstair`, and installs it into Homebrew's `bin` directory.  
You do not need to manually rename or move any files.
